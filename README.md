# oop-game
 splits a phrase into letters. 
 As the player hits a letter, all instances of that letter appear on screen. 
 If they guess a wrong letter 5 times, the game ends.
 Once they guess the word, they win.

Works with either clicking on the keys or typing the keys.

Changes to appearance:

added the individual words to div elements and bottom margins to the divs and individual letters in order to accomadate smaller screen sizes.

added border around the phrase blocks and the keyboard to make it look a bit better.

added a hover function on the keys to make them look pressed

made the screen flash red when a wrong letter is selected

added a warning label in the start screen about the flashing color!
